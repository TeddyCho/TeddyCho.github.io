# Tasks
> Visualize trades and quotes (TAQ) data.
> Include a comparison of continuous limit order book (CLOB) and frequent batch auctions (FBA).

# Data
The TAQ data covered the following time frame and symbols:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>      <th>Timeframe</th> <th>Symbol</th> <th>Exchange</th>   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>      <td>09-July-2014 to 09-July-2014</td>
      <td>GOOG</td> 
      <td>NASDAQ OMX BX</td> 
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

# Visualization

When trades are grouped by their symbols' listing exchanges, we observe differences across their exchange market share profiles during regular hours. Notably, exchanges held higher market share for their "home" stocks:

# To Do
* Given TAQ data, simulate the FBA supply/demand curves and the resulting trades.
